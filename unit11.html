                <b>Task 1</b> - For the first assignment I had to explain the uses and features of a small office network and a multi-player network where people like to play computer games simultaneously,
                choosing one of the two networks to review how the uses and features of one of the networks affect the user experience, 
                discuss a minimum of one strength and one weakness of the network from the points listed below

                <b>Task 2</b> - For the second assignment we had to design and develop a small computer network for a company called First Music Network Solutions. 
                Which employees in the office setting will all be using stand-alone computer systems and are connected to a laser printer.
                I had to consider how to design a computer network, what is needed to set-up to configure the components, use software to test our design ideas, consider alternatives,
                what should be included within a test plan and to make sure the network design meets te user requirements
