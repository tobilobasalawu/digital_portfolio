            In this unit I Investigated the features and uses of databases by exploring what they are and what you can do with them. 
            I was able to apply some of my findings to the database solution. I learnt how to use database software to design, develop and test relational databases for a brief. 
            Once completed, i reviewed the database, having obtained feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements

              I choose to look at (Health Sector and the Policing Sector) were a lot different to what I had imagined and what they held was a wide range of information about everyone employed or entered in to the database for one reason or another
