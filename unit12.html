            The software development unit covers the purpose and characteristics of software applications and how to design, and develop a software application to fulfill a predetermined list of specifications. 
            This unit teaches students how a software application is created, by looking closely at the development process . 
            In this unit I explored the purposes, uses and key features of applications to acquire a greater level of understanding when developing applications.

              <b>Task 1</b> -  Demonstrated my knowledge of the characteristics and uses of software applications by creating a PowerPoint presentation, explaining the key features and commands of two different software applications for the pass grade. 
              Then reviewing how the features affect the usability and purpose of the application for the merit grade, and finally, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the applications for the distinction grade.

              <b>Task 2</b> - 
              I used the predetermined requirements for the given scenario to design a software application for the client, a local travel agent. 
              I identified the purpose and user requirements for the application as specified in the client’s briefing. Then created a proposed design solution using a range of tools to develop a prototype for the client, listing any assets and any pre-defined functions and subroutines used in my design. 
              Then I produced an alternative design prototype, and justified my design decisions as to which design fulfilled the client’s requirements as stated in the brief.
