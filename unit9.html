              In this unit, i understood the many uses for spreadsheets. I discovered
               many tools and techniques that are available in spreadsheet software and will 
              become skilled at using them. Investigated some of the ways spreadsheets 
              used in real-life. Also developed and tested  spreadsheet solution to store, manipulate and analyse a large 
              amount of data and present the output data in easy-to-understand way. Once 
              completed, the finished spreadsheet solution will reviewed having obtained 
              feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements.
